# Library Server Project

This repository hosts the configuration and setup files for a Linux-based server project designed for a local library. The server provides essential services to streamline library management, including:

- **DHCP and DNS**: Automated IP assignment and domain name resolution.
- **Nginx Web Server**: Hosts the libraryâ€™s website for internal and external access.
- **File Backup and Management**: Regular backups with options for weekly snapshots and secure storage.
- **Secure SSH Access**: Allows administrators to securely manage the server remotely.

This project aims to create a cost-effective, stable, and open-source infrastructure for libraries with minimal hardware requirements and no need for proprietary software licenses.

## Features

- DHCP and DNS for seamless network management
- Nginx for fast and reliable web hosting
- Data backup and restoration protocols
- User documentation and live demo for easy maintenance
